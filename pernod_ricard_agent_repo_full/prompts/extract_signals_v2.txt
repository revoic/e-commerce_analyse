2. EVERY signal MUST include a supporting quote from the article
3. Quotes can be paraphrased slightly for clarity, but must be representative
4. Focus on: Sales, Revenue, Market share, E-commerce metrics, Partnerships, Product launches, Strategy
5. Target regions: EU (especially Germany), then worldwide
6. Use reasonable inference when facts are clearly indicated
7. Extract numbers even if context is partial - we can validate later

{article_url}

**YOUR RESPONSE:**

  "signals": [
    {{
      "type": "ecommerce",
      "verbatim_quote": "representative quote from article",
      "source_title": "article title",
      "source_url": "article url",
      "confidence": 0.6,

      "value": {{
        "headline": "Online growth",
        "fact": "Company achieved strong online sales growth",

      }}
    }}
  ]
}}

**REMEMBER:**
- Every signal needs a supporting quote
- Quote should be representative of the fact
- Extract all relevant signals, even if confidence is moderate (0.4+)
- Better to extract more signals with appropriate confidence scores than to miss relevant information
- Include "type" field: financial, ecommerce, retail_media, marketplace, d2c, partnership, product, strategy, leadership, markets
- Include "extraction_reasoning" field explaining your confidence level

Now extract ALL relevant signals from the article above. Be thorough and extract anything that could be valuable.
