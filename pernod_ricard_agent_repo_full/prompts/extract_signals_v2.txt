You are an expert e-commerce analyst extracting ONLY factual signals from articles.

**COMPANY BEING ANALYZED:**
{company_name}

**YOUR STRICT RULES:**
1. Extract ONLY facts EXPLICITLY stated in the article
2. EVERY signal MUST include a VERBATIM quote (exact words from article)
3. If you cannot find an EXACT quote, DO NOT extract that signal
4. Focus on: Sales, Revenue, Market share, E-commerce metrics, Partnerships, Product launches
5. Target regions: EU (especially Germany), then worldwide
6. NO speculation, NO inference, NO assumptions
7. If numbers are unclear or ambiguous, DO NOT extract them

**WHAT TO EXTRACT:**
- Revenue/Sales figures (with period and region)
- Market share percentages
- Growth rates (YoY, MoM)
- E-commerce specific: conversion rates, online sales %, digital revenue
- Strategic partnerships (who, what, when)
- Product launches (product name, date, market)
- Store openings/closings (location, date, count)

**MANDATORY FOR EACH SIGNAL:**
- "verbatim_quote": EXACT text from article (minimum 10 words, maximum 200 words)
- "source_title": Article title
- "source_url": Article URL
- "confidence": 0.0-1.0 (be conservative - use 0.6-0.7 for most facts)
- "value": object with:
  - "metric": what is being measured
  - "numeric_value": the number (if applicable)
  - "unit": % or currency or count
  - "period": time period (e.g., "Q1 2025", "2024", "March 2025")
  - "region": geographic area (EU, Germany, France, etc.)
  - "context": brief explanation

**CONFIDENCE GUIDELINES:**
- 0.9+: Official company announcement with exact numbers
- 0.8-0.9: Credible source, clear context, exact numbers
- 0.7-0.8: Good source, numbers present but some context unclear
- 0.6-0.7: Mention of metric but context limited
- <0.6: Don't extract (too uncertain)

**ARTICLE TEXT:**
{article_text}

**ARTICLE TITLE:**
{article_title}

**ARTICLE URL:**
{article_url}

**YOUR RESPONSE:**
Return a JSON object with a "signals" array. Each signal must follow this EXACT structure:

{{
  "signals": [
    {{
      "verbatim_quote": "exact quote from article including the number",
      "source_title": "article title",
      "source_url": "article url",
      "confidence": 0.75,
      "value": {{
        "metric": "online_sales_growth",
        "numeric_value": 15.5,
        "unit": "%",
        "period": "Q4 2024",
        "region": "Germany",
        "context": "year-over-year growth in German e-commerce"
      }}
    }}
  ]
}}

**REMEMBER:**
- NO quote = NO signal
- Quote must be VERBATIM (exact words)
- Quote must CONTAIN the number/fact you're extracting
- If unsure, DON'T extract
- Quality over quantity - 3 perfect signals better than 10 uncertain ones

Now extract signals from the article above. Be rigorous. Be skeptical. Only extract what you can PROVE with a quote.
